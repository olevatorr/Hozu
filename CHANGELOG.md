# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — first public release

All packages are published under `@tenonkit/*`, plus [`create-tenon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-tenon).

### Authoring
- **Declarations:**
  - features, one state machine per feature, typed events, queries, mutations, tags, `fn`s, views, widgets and
    messages;
  - `feature({ id, intent, declarations })` sorts declarations by kind (ADR 0022).
- **Contracts:** given / when / expect for every transition. `expect.changes` states only what changes. A behaviour
  lock catches drift (TN016, TN018).
- **Views:** typed element trees with every HTML/SVG element, typed attributes and DOM events, `toggle` and `vars`,
  Tailwind classes checked against the generated CSS, `ui.if`, `ui.each`, `ui.query` and motion.
- **Routes:**
  - typed `params` and `search`, with the `:x?`, `:x+` and `:x*` modifiers;
  - `ui.link` is the only form of an internal URL;
  - soft navigation keeps UI alive across links.
- **Forms:** work without JavaScript. Field errors come from the `Invalid` error, and there is a pattern for
  optimistic items.
- **Other features:**
  - i18n with typed messages and `Intl` formatting;
  - typed `env`;
  - sessions, CSP and cross-site POST checks;
  - Markdown collections;
  - image `srcset` and share images;
  - preview mode, PWA and an offline page;
  - `@tenonkit/testing`.

### Rendering
- **Render plans are derived per node:** static, ISR, SWR, streamed or client. User-scoped data cannot reach a
  cacheable region.
- **Server HTML comes from generated JavaScript** (ADR 0024). `tenon build` writes it for edge runtimes.
- **The client runtime** hydrates only machine-bound islands. It is 7.5 KB gzipped, with a compact payload and
  modulepreload (ADR 0023).

### Tools
- `tenon validate | inspect | graph | explain | impact | plan | build | skill`, all with `--json` and JSON Schemas.
- 43 diagnostic codes, each with a location, a cause and a fix.
- `create-tenon --agent claude|agents|both`: writes `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, plus the versioned authoring skill
  with a verified example.

### Requirements
- Node 22.18 or newer.
